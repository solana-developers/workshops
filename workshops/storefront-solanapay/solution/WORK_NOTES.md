# Work Notes:

These changes are just some concepts for our app's layout. Some layout changes still required:
* [ ] Pizza image background
* [ ] Heading kinda sucks
* [ ] Order completed screen ??

Also we need to get the Solana Pay stuff working correctly:
* [ ] SPL Token support for Pay
* [ ] Get devnet to work with Pay URL
* [ ] NFT coupons ??

Then we just need to decide how we're going to conduct the session.
